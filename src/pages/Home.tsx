            <Title level={4} style={bodyTextStyle}>
              This dual-use space is not only where we ferment our own wines and ciders but also where we host all types of events, from birthday celebrations and late-night dance parties to chef pop-ups, screenings, floral markets, and wedding receptions.
              <br />
              <br />
              The beating heart of the space is our custom sound system, which combines the latest in audio science with the artistry of a hand-made object. The system, a collaboration between local artist Peter Brock and Paris-based audio engineer Nicholas Badey, utilizes some of the highest performing speaker components in the world.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our fermentation program produces small batch wines and ciders using locally grown fruits as well as herbs from our own rooftop garden.
              <br />
              <br />
              Opening in summer 2025, the open kitchen will be a place where visiting chefs showcase their unique culinary perspectives.
